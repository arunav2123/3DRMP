# RMP_package
Suite of physics codes to simulate 3D RMP plasma responses in next generation tokamaks

1. Monte-Carlo simualtion code for collisional particle transport from \
      a. Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) \
      b. Ion-Cyclotron Radio Frequency (ICRF)\
    c. DT fusion born energetic particles

3. In-built Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMP) Coil Construction (Up-down symmetric) \
    a.  User-defined parameters-> Phase Perturbations, Coil Engeneering, Inductances, (R,Z) Location \
    b. Calculates Vaccum Field from Bio-Savart Law \
    c. Inlcusion of Plasma response to RMP (Devlopin..) 

4. Runaway Electron Mitigation Coil (REMC) (Devlopin..)
