# RMP_package
Suite of physics codes to simulate 3D RMP plasma responses in next generation tokamaks

1. Monte-Carlo simualtion code for collisional particle transport from
    i. Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) 
    ii. Ion-Cyclotron Radio Frequency (ICRF)
    iii. DT fusion born energetic particles

2. In-built Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMP) Coil Construction (Up-down symmetric)
    i.  User-defined parameters-> Phase Perturbations, Coil Engeneering, Inductances, (R,Z) Location
    ii. Calculates Vaccum Field from Bio-Savart Law
    iii. Inlcusion of Plasma response to RMP (DEV..)

4. Runaway Electron Mitigation Coil (REMC) (DEV..)
